## hash code
A team programming competition – you pick your team and programming language to solve an engineering problem. Are you up for the challenge?

### What is Hash Code?
Google’s team-based programming competition, Hash Code, allows you to share your skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve 
a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem 
through Qualification Round. Though this round is hosted online, teams can come together virtually to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated 
Hash Code Hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to join us for the virtual World Finals.

### How it works
This is our online platform where you’ll form your team, join a Hub, practice, and compete during the rounds. During the Qualification Round, 
you’ll watch our YouTube livestream to be introduced to the problem, and your team will have four hours to solve an optimization problem using 
the programming language and tools of your choice. Teams can also compete alongside other teams in your area by joining a virtual Hub. 
The top teams from the Qualification Round will be invited to the virtual World Finals, where they’ll work together to solve another challenge 
and compete for cash prizes.

## code jam
Put your skills to the test as you work your way through multiple rounds of algorithmic puzzles for the title of Code Jam Champ and $15,000 USD. Do you have what it takes?

### What is Code Jam?
Google’s longest running global coding competition, Code Jam, calls on programmers around the world to solve challenging, algorithmic puzzles against the clock. Contestants advance through four online-hosted rounds to compete at the annual Code Jam World Finals that is held at a different international Google office each year. Each round brings new challenges, and in the end 25 contestants will have the ultimate chance to put their skills to the test, vying for cash prizes and the coveted championship title at the World Finals.

### How it works
Register and compete in Code Jam’s Online Qualification Round. It lasts 27 hours, but you won't need that long to earn the round’s qualifying point minimum. Once you do, you’ll advance to Online Round 1. We offer three sub-rounds for Round 1, and you can compete in as many as it takes for you to finish in the top 1,500 of any of these rounds.

The top 1,500 from each sub-round move on to compete for a spot in the top 1,000 contestants of Code Jam Online Round 2. These top 1,000 contestants advance to Online Round 3 and earn a limited edition Code Jam t-shirt.

The top 25 contestants from Code Jam Online Round 3 will compete in the Virtual World Finals for the championship title and a cash prize of $15,000 USD.

## Kick start
Hone your coding skills with algorithmic puzzles meant for students and those new to coding competitions. Participate in one round or join them all. What are you waiting for?


### What is Kick Start?
Kick Start offers coders around the world the chance to develop and hone their programming skills through online-hosted competition rounds. The three-hour rounds feature a variety of algorithmic challenges, all developed by Google engineers so that you get a taste of the technical skills needed for a career at Google (the top competitors from our Kick Start rounds may be invited to interview at Google!). Our rounds are held regularly throughout the year at different times so they are easily accessible to coders everywhere. Each Kick Start Round is open to all participants, no pre-qualification needed, so you can try your hand at one or give them all a shot. In addition to our online rounds, we are hosting several Coding Practice with Kick Start sessions throughout the competition season. If you are looking for some extra practice, try these low-pressure multi-day practice sessions to learn more about our problems and platform with dedicated Google engineering support to get you ready for the next upcoming Kick Start round.

### How it works
Register for Kick Start once on our website and you’ll be set up to compete in any round you’d like! When each round is open, the three-hour countdown begins and you’ll compete on our website solving algorithmic and mathematical problems. Following the round, you can check out your rankings and the round analysis. If you were a top competitor, you may be contacted by Google for a chance to interview.
